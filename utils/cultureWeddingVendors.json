DO NOT HIRE RECALL IMAGES IF YOU WANT TO RECALL ANYTHING. His company is shut down. \n\nDetails:\n\nWe hired Rounak for our engagement ceremony on the Dec 2022. He seemed like a good and friendly person at first. He asked for advance and then the full payment post the event. He told us it was the industry norm so we obliged and handed him the entire amount.\n\nPost this he took weeks to give us the photographs of the event. These came out well but he missed out a lot of people at the event and the number of photographs were a lot less than expected. But the quality was good. What we had realized is that he had gotten his friend along with him and he was the photographer. He was from Rikaar images, and we realized that he was the person responsible for the beautiful images in the first place. The person from Rikaar saved the event with his beautiful pictures. \n\nWe had paid Rounak (Recall Images) the full amount for even a video. He kept delaying for weeks stating one excuse or another. After 2 months he stopped replying all together. No reply to messages or to calls. He just ran away with the money. We even asked Rikaar to help us locate him but he told us Rounak was not picking up even his phone calls.\n\nWe then did more research (which we should have done before) and realized that he had done the same with others as well. And his employees were not paid. His IG is not updated and his company is more or less shut down. \n\nMy sincerest request to all of you. DO NOT HIRE RECALL. You can explore Rikaar or any other photographer. But DO NOT take recall if you want to avoid a nightmare.\n\nMessage me for proof or any other explanations.

They were punctual with timings; whether it was 5 am in the morning or 2 am at night, they were there.\n\n2. They remained invisible during the functions, we had no idea where they were capturing moments from and the best part they never asked to pose or stand in a certain way for pictures.
