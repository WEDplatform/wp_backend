Krishnchandra Events was among them. I contacted all three, discussed our vision for the wedding in great detail, and requested detailed quotes. Krishnchandra Events quickly became our top choice, and we were on the verge of finalizing them.\nHowever, unfortunately, we ended up choosing our second favorite planner (after paying a deposit) because they were based in our city, which we thought would make communication easier as the wedding approached. (Out of respect for privacy, I will not disclose the name, but it will become apparent later). \n\nFast forward to October, two months before our wedding, everything was going according to plan. We were relaxed and simply basking in the excitement of our upcoming dream event. Suddenly, our chosen planner caused a complete breakdown in communication and disappeared.\nTo make a long story short, we were forced to make the difficult decision to change planners at the last minute, 2 months before our wedding.\nThen, Krishnchandra Events emerged as our savior. Despite our initial hesitation, they literally saved us, stepping in when it was almost too late.\nCan you imagine a planner who had been booked showing no interest in meeting with their clients, while another, whom we had not initially chosen and who wasn't even based in our city, was kind enough to meet with us on just 12 hours' notice? \n\nThat's why we call it a Kismat Connection with Krishnchandra Events! They were destined to plan and curate our wedding. \n\nNow I'll explain in details that how they become a part of our family: \n\nBasically the admin of KrishnaChandra Events are a Band Baja Barat ditto sweet couple 'Shivani and Ankit' who give their all to make your wedding more special. \n\nShivani is more of a service provider and less of a businesswoman. She has the capacity to incur a loss to give you better service.\nFrom decor to all services, she and her team took care of every detail, swift and beautifully. \n\nWe were absolutely delighted with the exceptional service provided by the KC team for our wedding!\nFrom the very first meeting, it was clear that they were dedicated to bringing our dream wedding to life, offering personalized attention and demonstrating unparalleled professionalism every step of the way.\nThroughout the wedding, we never faced a single issue. \n\nThe imagination of our wedding that we had in our minds was understood well by her, that she created the same in reality with each and every detail, making it even more beautiful than we imagined.\nTheir ability to understand our vision and preferences was truly remarkable, and they went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was perfect. The planning process was seamless, thanks to their exceptional organizational skills, creativity, and vast network of high-quality vendors.\nApart from our requirements, she helped us with so many small details that we forgot to mention to them at first place. \n\nDuring all 3 days including all functions, everything flowed smoothly, allowing us to truly enjoy every moment without any stress. The decor was breathtaking, the timeline was executed flawlessly, and every element came together better than we could have ever imagined.\nThere were a lot of small things where shivani really shown her reliable side. \n\nOur relatives and guests still praise their work and efforts. Our whole family to this day feels so grateful towards them.\nReally Shivani and Ankit are so adorable that you'll forget they are planners because they will become a cousin or friend who is curating your wedding. \n\nwe loved them so much that we immediately finalized them for my brother's wedding (even though he hasn't finalized the bride... haha). \n\nAs closing lines: Giving our dream wedding into the hands of Shivani & Ankit was the best decision! Touch wood.\nPassion for their work shines through in the happiness of their clients. We are beyond grateful for their dedication and hard work, which made our special day unforgettable.\nI highly recommend Shivani & Ankit known as 'KrishnaChandra Events' to any couple looking for a wedding planner who will go the extra mile to ensure their wedding day is nothing short of magical. \n\nThey are Magical!\n\nShukriya with Regards,\nKIVISHA\nDr. Kiran Singh & Dr. Vishal Singh\n\n\u2764\ud83e\uddff"],["Aayush Rinwa","5.0","Top notch Decor, event and Management by KrishnChandra Events.\nThey were always a step ahead than what was promised.\n\nThank You Shivani and team for making my day amazingly beautiful!!!\n\nHighly recommend to make your day extra special!"],["MridulMaheshwary","5.0","I wanted to take a moment to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you for orchestrating such a beautiful and memorable wedding for Mohit and Abha.

She is a watercolour and digital artist, illustrator, and designer. She is inspired by the natural world around her and everything from the changing colours of the season, to the intricacy of a flower, inspire her. She lives between India, Ireland and the Netherlands but works on projects worldwide. She is passionate about creating lasting and beloved pieces of artwork and illustrations. Every invite that she designs has hand-painted illustrations using watercolours or mixed digital media.From the artist of Pale Pink Studio- Suruchi Gulati\u201cI always used to notice how such beautiful and extravagant wedding invitations just became trash after the wedding was over. I wanted to think of something that didn\u2019t create so much waste and also a way to gift a keepsake to the guest along with the invitation. Because I am an artist before I am an invite designer, I thought why not design the invitations in a way that the guest receives an art print that they can later get framed and hang on their walls, or if the budget allows, give them a framed artwork along with a small page of the invite. This kind of invite is sustainable and also reusable by the guest, and a wonderful keepsake of the beautiful memories a wedding holds. All the invites I design have a sense of sustainability. They will make your guests happy and give them artwork for their homes along with a wedding invitation! I try to be organic and illustrate with an aesthetic of subtle grace. Many of my pieces feature mixed textures from materials like handmade recycled cotton paper, vellum, and recycled fabric.\u201dWorking Style of Pale Pink StudioPale Pink Studio is passionate about working closely with their clients to create wedding stationery as closely as possible. The artist listens carefully to each idea and works to combine all your ideas into a creation that is personal and beautiful. They hand illustrate each element of your invite, using watercolours or digitally, then design everything digitally using the hand-painted elements. Pale Pink Studio can make digital E-invites or hard copies of the same using artisan environment-friendly papers.

They captured so many beautiful candid moments, as well as politely corralled guests for group photos, all while keeping constant documentation of us (the bride and groom). They made sure to learn who was who in both sides of our family so that they could give enough coverage to our parents and close relatives as well. They made sure to handle all planning and info gathering well in advance of our events so that they could operate independently, allowing us to focus fully on the wedding. \n\nTheir filming of the wedding and mehendi ceremonies was beautifully cinematic, and captured not only the bride and groom, but also the guests reactions, excitement, and happiness. \n\nThe team was flexible with the unexpected but often unavoidable last minute changes that happen in weddings, and were always courteous, professional, and warm.\n\nWe and our families have framed so many photographs from the event captured by Tanushree Bhasin Photography.

Right from the planning to execution and delivery Tanushree was personally involved with each and every aspect of the work and due this personal touch they truly understand the type of clients they are working with and their tastes and work with you accordingly. We don't like to pose much and they were made fully aware of the same and were fully sensitive towards that. We specifically wanted more of candid work and they truly delivered with 5 star quality. Also, they were very punctual, we never had to call Tanushree to be on time, in fact it was the opposite, they reached before time on every venue and called us everytime as we were running late!\n\nTheir technique is truly different from everyone else and their attention to detail is mind blowing. The cherry on top is the cinematography. Again, due the personal touch involved they know you as a client and what you want in terms of songs in the videos too and they didn't disappoint at all. The songs completely compliment the earthy wedding we had.\n\nAll in all I would say you get what you pay for.

DO NOT HIRE RECALL IMAGES IF YOU WANT TO RECALL ANYTHING. His company is shut down. \n\nDetails:\n\nWe hired Rounak for our engagement ceremony on the Dec 2022. He seemed like a good and friendly person at first. He asked for advance and then the full payment post the event. He told us it was the industry norm so we obliged and handed him the entire amount.\n\nPost this he took weeks to give us the photographs of the event. These came out well but he missed out a lot of people at the event and the number of photographs were a lot less than expected. But the quality was good. What we had realized is that he had gotten his friend along with him and he was the photographer. He was from Rikaar images, and we realized that he was the person responsible for the beautiful images in the first place. The person from Rikaar saved the event with his beautiful pictures. \n\nWe had paid Rounak (Recall Images) the full amount for even a video. He kept delaying for weeks stating one excuse or another. After 2 months he stopped replying all together. No reply to messages or to calls. He just ran away with the money. We even asked Rikaar to help us locate him but he told us Rounak was not picking up even his phone calls.\n\nWe then did more research (which we should have done before) and realized that he had done the same with others as well. And his employees were not paid. His IG is not updated and his company is more or less shut down. \n\nMy sincerest request to all of you. DO NOT HIRE RECALL. You can explore Rikaar or any other photographer. But DO NOT take recall if you want to avoid a nightmare.\n\nMessage me for proof or any other explanations.

For us, it was The Wedding Files. A good seven to eight months before the wedding, we started narrowing down our long list of potential photographers. We evaluated Instagram pages, reviews of wedding pages, prices, and other factors and concluded that The Wedding Files, without any doubt, was the best option.\n\nLet me list some things that stood out for us\n\n1. They were punctual with timings; whether it was 5 am in the morning or 2 am at night, they were there.\n\n2. They remained invisible during the functions, we had no idea where they were capturing moments from and the best part they never asked to pose or stand in a certain way for pictures. Whatever they captured was natural to its core.\n\n3. The edited images and movies were stunningly gorgeous and captivating. We were blown away by the shooting angles, background music, and overall storytelling of our marriage.\n\n4. They were quite nice in listening to us about any changes we thought were necessary. Although their creativity and ability to put things together rank among the best in the wedding industry. \n\nOur experience with them was so good that now one of my friends has also selected them for his wedding shoot in Thailand. And by the way, we got our pre-wedding done from them too and it's difficult to describe the feeling of joy which we feel every time we watch it.\n\nAll in all, we are extremely happy and satisfied with the services and they have become our friends. Special shoutout to Shivam, Jogi, Diljeet and Amrit. You guys rock and we love your work!"],["Devika","5.0","Amazing work!
